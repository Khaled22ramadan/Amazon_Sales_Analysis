# Amazon_Sales_Analysis
# Overview
This project analyzes an Amazon product dataset to uncover insights about product categories, pricing, discounts, and customer ratings. The analysis was conducted using Python and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This project was completed during my internship at NTI, and I‚Äôm excited to share it as part of my portfolio to showcase my data analysis skills.

# Dataset

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset

The dataset contains information about 1,465 products, including:

Product ID

Product Name

Category

Discounted Price

Actual Price

Discount Percentage

Rating

Rating Count

About Product

User Reviews

# Steps Performed
# 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values and duplicates.

Converted data types for numerical columns (e.g., prices, ratings).

Extracted and transformed key features like product categories and discount percentages.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed price distributions, discount trends, and rating patterns.

Visualized relationships between variables to uncover insights.

# 3. Key Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Top-Performing Categories:

Products in the "SmartWatches" and "PowerBanks" categories had the highest average ratings, indicating strong customer satisfaction.

"USBCables" and "WirelessUSBAdapters" were among the most discounted categories, with discounts averaging over 50%.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Discount Impact:

Products with higher discounts (60% or more) tended to have higher sales volumes, but their average ratings were slightly lower compared to products with moderate discounts (30-50%).

This suggests that while discounts drive sales, they may also attract more critical reviews.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Price vs. Rating:

There was a weak positive correlation between product price and rating, indicating that more expensive products tend to have slightly better ratings.

However, the relationship wasn‚Äôt strong, suggesting that factors like brand reputation and product quality play a more significant role in customer satisfaction.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Popular Price Range:

The majority of products fell in the ‚Çπ500 to ‚Çπ2000 price range, making this the most competitive segment.

Products in this range also had the highest number of reviews, indicating high customer engagement.
